Here we show an example of how to integrate external data with the TCGA one.
We used RNASEQ data from the GEO entry GSE60052 as a source of external data and TCGA-LUAD as TCGA
dataset for the example.
It is important that for real applications, the user will carefully start the best practice for
data integration, as well as it is strongly raccomended to start from the raw data of the external dataset
and processes them in a way that is consistent with the counts provided by TCGA.
